## About This Space

This space is for sharing my opinions, thoughts, and advice on testing and quality assurance, drawn from my personal experience. The articles here won't follow any particular sequence but will focus on the quality assurance of web applications. 

My aim is to keep articles short and to the point, while offering perspectives that encourage QA professionals and developers to think differently about testing and quality.

## About Me

I’ve spent around a decade working in QA, starting as a manual tester, moving into QA Automation, and now working as a Senior SDET and QA lead. Throughout my career, I’ve developed a deep passion for all things quality assurance, and I love exploring and discussing the many areas of testing and quality.

I firmly believe that effective testing begins with a solid understanding of what's being tested, which is why curiosity and continuous learning are at the core of my approach. As an advocate for continuous testing, shift-left quality, and fast feedback, I focus on principles that help deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently.
