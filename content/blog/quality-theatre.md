There exists a phenomenon known as "Security Theatre" which is briefly described as practices that create the illusion of security without necessarily making anyone safer; it's more about the "performance" than the practicality – convincing people that something is being done regardless of efficacy.

Similar to security theatre, “quality theatre” may involve practices and processes that focus more on producing shiny looking metrics, or meeting stakeholder expectations, rather than focusing on what really matters - delivering reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly software.

Some examples of this would include:

* Focusing on quantity over quality when creating test cases
* Flaky tests that simply show green in the report
* Tests that describe one thing but do another
* Sharing high, arbitrary coverage percentages
* Dshboards that prioritise aesthetics over actionable insights

### Why Does Quality Theatre Happen?

In my experience, this happens when there's a pressure to demonstrate value, or something that drives prioritising compliance over meaningful testing, such as imposed rigid requirements (e.g. "We need 100% test coverage").

### Avoiding Theatrics

Quality cannot be measured alone by the number of test cases or the size of a report; it’s about whether the product works as expected and provides a good experience for the end user.

Measure what matters, like defect escape rate, system reliability, or user satisfaction. Avoid "vanity" metrics that may look good but lack substance.
