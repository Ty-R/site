The difference between Quality and Quality Assurance may seem obvious, but in practice, the lines often blur, especially when strategising or measuring success.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <strong>Quality</strong>
        <p>The standard of the end product, how well it meets requirements and user expectations (think function, usability, performance, accessiblity)</p>
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <strong>Quality Assurance</strong>
        <p>The process(es) of ensuring quality by testing, monitoring, and refining to generally prevent defects and improve reliability</p>
    </div>
</div>

Simply put - **Quality** is the end result; **QA** is the process to achieve it. This distinction is important when defining what success looks like.

Here are some metrics that are often tied to quality, but shouldn't be mistaken for quality itself:

* Test coverage percentage
* Issue/defect count
* Story points delivered
* Automated test execution rates
* Deployment frequency

While these may not represent quality directly, they can be used to measure the strength of a QA process -- as a result of high test coverage, more frequent deployments, fewer reported issues, we'd **_expect_** a higher-quality product, but to be sure, we'd need additional metrics.

## Measuring Quality

Quality itself is often a challenge to measure as it's context-dependent, but here are some common approaches:

* User feedback or customer satisfaction
* User retention rates
* Defect escape rates
* System up-time, response times, and similar performance metrics
* Accessiblity audits and compliance adherence
* DORA metrics (failure rates, recovery times)
