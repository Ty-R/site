The difference between Quality and Quality Assurance may seem obvious, but in practice, the lines often blur, especially when strategising or measuring success.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <strong>Quality</strong>
        <p>The standard of the end product, how well it meets requirements and user expectations (think function, usability, performance, accessiblity)</p>
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <strong>Quality Assurance</strong>
        <p>The process of ensuring quality by testing, monitoring, and refining to generally prevent defects and improve reliability</p>
    </div>
</div>

Simply put - **Quality** is the end result and **QA** is the process to achieve it; this distinction is important when defining what success looks like.

Here are some metrics that are often tied to quality, but shouldn't be mistaken for quality itself:

* Test coverage percentage
* Issue/defect count
* Story points delivered
* Automated test execution rates
* Deployment frequency

While these may not represent quality directly, they can be used to measure the strength of a QA process -- as a result of high test coverage, more frequent deployments, fewer reported issues, we'd **_expect_** a higher-quality product, but to be sure, we'd need additional metrics.

## Measuring Quality

Quality itself is a challenge to measure as it's heavily context-dependent, but we can start by breaking it down into objective attributes that reflect a product's quality, like:

| Perspective    | Quality Attributes |
| -------- | ------- |
| End user  |   Performant, accessible, usable, responsive, seamless, portable  |
| Engineering | Reliable, secure, scalable, maintainable, testable, resilient, interoperable, efficient     |
| Business    | Cost-efficient, compliant, adaptable    |

With these attributes defined, we can direct our focus on them induvidually to paint a clear picture of where a product currently is, and where it should be, in the context of each attribute.
